# React Weather

[A simple react app that shows current weathere and 6-days forecast.](https://denkick.github.io/weather-react)

It uses Geolocation API to define location, Weatherbit API to define weather in user's location and weather icons and react components to show it to user. 

App is full adaptive and looks good on tablets and smartphones.
